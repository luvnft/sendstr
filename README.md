Sendstr is an e2e encrypted bi-directional clipboard web app powered by Nostr.

The main motivation to build X was to provide a quick and easy way to transfer text and files (coming soon) between devices. X defaults to a self-hosted Nostr relay but can easily be configured to point elsewhere.

## Build

```
cd sendstr-web
npm i
npm run export
```

Then copy the contents of `./out` to your favorite static content host.

- [ ] React native client
